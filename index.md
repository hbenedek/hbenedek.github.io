My name is Ben, I am a Mathematician from Hungary. I learn Data Science and Financial Engineering in Lausanne (EPFL). I am interested in Machine Learning, Statistics, Probability Theory and Graph Theory. I do coding in Python, but i am currently learning C++ and Scala as well. In my freetime, I enjoy playing chess, reding books and hiking.
