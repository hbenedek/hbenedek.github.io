Hi!

My name is Ben. I learn Data Science and Financial Engineering at [École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne](https://www.epfl.ch/en/). Before coming to Lausanne, I studied Mathematics at [Eötvös Lóránd University](https://www.elte.hu/en/). I am interested in Machine Learning, Statistics, Probability Theory and Graph Theory. I code in Python, but i am currently learning C++ and Scala as well. In my freetime, I enjoy playing chess, reading books and hiking.

I make visualizations from Formula 1 laptime and result data to keep my Pandas and Seaborn/Matplotlib knowledge sharpe. If you are interested, check it out on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/f1.plotted/) or [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/hben0204).
