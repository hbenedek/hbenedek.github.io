Under construction.

This project was made as part of the course [CS-401 Machine Learning](https://edu.epfl.ch/coursebook/en/machine-learning-CS-433) at EPFL (fall 2021). Unclear relationships between politicians and lob-byists are a problem in a democratic political framework. Usingvarious  methods,  we  attempt  to  detect  links  between  Twitteractivity  of  Members  of  the  European  Parliament  and  lobbygroups. 

Special thanks to my teammates Kamil Czerniak and Mohamed Allouch. I would like to acredit our supervisor, Aswin Suresh and the [Information and Network Dynamics Lab](https://indy.epfl.ch/) for making this project possible.
Under construction!

TODO:

 - Data exploration (retwwet graph, processing the tweets) 
 - Link prediction task, baseline model
 - Logistic regression, GCN
