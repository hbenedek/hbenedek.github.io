[Ticket to Ride](https://www.daysofwonder.com/tickettoride/en/) is a board game where the players have to collect cards and build railway routes between cities. In a mathematical point of view we need to claim edges in a graph and connect various nodes in it. So the obvious questions is are there any nodes, ore edges in this graph which are strategically more important than others, and if this is the case how can we construct such an importance metrics.

Let's start with some basic statistics. We can check out the number of nodes, edges and the average degree of a node, which is $\huge{Avg_d = \lvert E \rvert /\lvert V \rvert}$. We can also take a look at the degree distribution of the nodes.

 - Number of nodes: 47
 - Number of edges: 90
 - Average degree: 1.91
