[Ticket to Ride](https://www.daysofwonder.com/tickettoride/en/) is a board game where the players have to collect cards and build railway routes between cities. In a mathematical point of view we need to claim edges in a graph and connect various nodes in it. So we have the obvious questions: Are there any nodes, or edges in this graph which are strategically more important than others, and if this is the case how can we construct such an importance metrics. Let's model the map with an undirected weighted graph $\huge{G=(V,E,w)}$, where $\huge{w}$ denotes the edge weights, equal to the length of the edge (how many card you need to collect to build the edge).

Let's start with some basic statistics. We can check out the number of nodes, edges and the average degree of a node, which is $\huge{Avg_d = \lvert E \rvert /\lvert V \rvert}$. We can also take a look at the degree distribution of the nodes.

 - Number of nodes: 47
 - Number of edges: 90
 - Average degree: 1.91

 Let's list the cities with the most degrees.

 - Paris        7
 - Kyiv         6
 - Frankfurt    6
 - Bucuresti    5
 - Wien         5
 
In Ticket to Ride every player holds some secret cards which determines which cities you should connect, these cards are called Tickets. You gain points by constructing this roads on the map. Another importance centrality is simply to count how many tickets end in a certain city. The winners are the following cities

 - Edinburgh    4
 - Bruxelles    3
 - Madrid       3
 - Barcelona    3
 - Brest        3

Another popular centrality is the [betweenness centrality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betweenness_centrality). The node betweenness centrality maps a score to each node based on shortest paths, in the following way: For each pair of nodes $\huge{u,v \in V}$ we construct a possible shortest path between them with the Dijkstra-algorithm. We simply count for each node how many shortest path crosses the underlying node. We can take this idea further, since in Ticket to Ride we shouldn't connect air possible pair of nodes, rather we should concentrate on a subset of those, the tickets. So for each ticket we construct the shortest path and count how many nodes crosses these shortest paths. These nodes may be really important to include in our path system to maximize our chances. 

 - Barcelona    12
 - Paris        12
 - London       11
 - Dieppe        9
 - Zurich        9

 The same algorithm can be applied for edges as well: for each edge we count the betweenness score based on the tickets in the game.

 - (Berlin, Frankfurt)    7
 - (Berlin, Warszawa)     5
 - (Venezia, Zurich)      5
 - (Venezia, Zagrab)      5
 - (Warszawa, Wilno)      5
 - Pamplona, Paris)       5
 - (Roma, Venezia)        5

A drawback of this approach is that we only considered a possible shortest path instead of all the shortest path, so the result may be a bit biased.
