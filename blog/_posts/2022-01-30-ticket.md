[Ticket to Ride](https://www.daysofwonder.com/tickettoride/en/) is a board game where the players have to collect cards and build railway routes between cities. In a mathematical point of view we need to claim edges in a graph and connect various nodes in it. So the obvious questions is are there any nodes, ore edges in this graph which are strategically more important than others, and if this is the case how can we construct such an importance metrics.
