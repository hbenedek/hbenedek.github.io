# Assumptions

A European Call Option gives the owner the possibility to buy a stock at a predefined price called the strike $\huge{K}$, at a predetermined time $\huge{T}$. It's payoff function is defined as $\huge{max(S_T-K,0)}$. We want to determine the fair price of the security, in other words what is the price we are willing to pay in order to enter this contract. We assume the followings

 - **Black-Scholes dynamics:** The stock price $\huge{S_t}$ is modeled by the geometric Browinian motion, so that it satisfies the stochastic differential equation $\huge{dS_t = S_t \alpha dt + S_t \sigma d W_t}$, where $\huge{W_t}$ is a Brownian motion.
 - **Risk-free asset:** The agent can invest in a risk-free asset, that pays constant interest rate of $\huge{r}$. If we invest $\huge{B_t}$ in this asset our wealth evolves by $\huge{dB_t = r B_t dt}$.
 - **Law of one Price:** If equivalent investment opportunities trade simultaneously in different markets, then they must trade for the same price in both markets
 - **Deterministic Price:** the value of the option at any time should depend on the time to expiration, and on the value of the stock price at that time, this means the price can be given as $\huge{c(t,S_t)}$, where $\huge{c(t,x)}$ is a deterministic function, its first argument represents time and the second argument represents the stock price at time $\huge{t}$, informally we substitute $\huge{x=S_t}$.

# Hedging with Ito Calculus 

 The idea is to  hedge a short position in the option, which means constructing a portfolio strategy of buying the stock and investing in the risk-free asset such that its payoff matches the payoff of the option. We will denote the value of this portfolio at time $\huge{t}$ by $\huge{X_t}$. If we can show such strategy, we can conclude by the Law of one Price that the fair price of this option should be equal to the value of this wealth process at any $\huge{t\in[0,T]}$. We can ensure this if we set the constraint, that their present value should be equal at any time. The equality will hold if $\huge{X_0=c(0,S_0)}$, and the process admits the stochastic differential equation 

 <center>
$$\huge{d(e^{-rt}X_t)=d(e^{-rt}c(t, S_t))}$$
</center>

We will use [Ito's lemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/It%C3%B4%27s_lemma) to expand the left and right hand-side of the equation. We start with the discounted stock price process and use the dynamics of $\huge{S_t}$

 <center>
$$\huge{d(e^{-rt}S_t=S_tde^{-rt}+e^{-rt}dS_t=-re^{-rt}S_tdt+e^{-rt}dS_t= \\
-re^{-rt}S_tdt+e^{-rt}[S_t \alpha dt + S_t \sigma d W_t]=
(\alpha-r)e^{-rt}S_tdt+\sigma e^{-rt}S_tdW_t}$$
</center>
The discounted wealth process can be derived similarly:
 <center>
$$\huge{d(e^{-rt}X_t)=X_tde^{-rt}+e^{-rt}dX_t=-re^{-rt}X_tdt+e^{-rt}dX_t}$$
</center>

Now we derive the dynamics of the portfolio evolution. The agent holds $\huge{\Delta_t}$ shares of stock at time $\huge{t}$, and he invests the remaining money in the risk free asset. We can use the stock price and risk-free dynamics to derive that the wealth process admits the following SDE

 <center>
$$\huge{dX_t=\Delta_tS_t+ r (X_t-\Delta_tS_t)dt = rX_tdt + \Delta_t(\alpha-r)S_tdt + \Delta_t\sigma S_tdW_t}$$
</center>

We can interpret the the terms as $\huge{r}$ being the risk-free return, $\huge{(\alpha-r)}$ is the risk-premium and $\huge{\sigma}$ is the volatility term. Putting the pieces together and substituting back for the discounted process we have

<center>
$$\huge{d(e^{-rt}X_t)=-re^{-rt}X_tdt+e^{-rt}[rX_tdt + \Delta_t(\alpha-r)S_tdt + \Delta_t\sigma S_tdW_t] = \\
[-re^{-rt}X_t + e^{-rt}[rX_tdt + \Delta_t(\alpha-r)S_t]dt+[\Delta_t\sigma S_t]dW_t = \Delta_t(\alpha-r)S_t]dt + \Delta_t\sigma S_t d W_t}$$
</center>


We again use Ito's formula for deriving $\huge{c(t,S_t)}$

 <center>
$$\huge{dc(t,S_t)=\partial_t c dt + \partial_x c dS_t+\frac{1}{2}\partial_{xx} cdS_tdS_t=
[\partial_t c + \alpha S_t \partial_x c+ \frac{1}{2}\sigma^2 S_t^2 \partial_{xx} c]dt + [\sigma S_t+ \partial_x c]dW_t}$$
</center>

And the discounted process admits

<center>
 $$\huge{d(e^{-rt}c(t,S_t))=-re^{-rt}c(t,S_t)dt+e^{-rt}dc(t,S_t))= \\e^{-rt}[-r c+\partial_t c + \alpha S(t) \partial_x c + \frac{1}{2}\sigma^2 S_t^2\partial_{xx}c]dt+e^{-rt}\sigma S_t\partial_x c dW_t}$$
</center>

We rearrange the terms, so that the $\huge{dt}$ and $\huge{dW_t}$ terms must be equal on both sides, this yields for the drift

<center>
$$\huge{\Delta_t=\partial_x c(t,S_t)}$$
</center>

The above formula is called the delta-hedging rule, it tells us how much fraction of our money should we invest in the stock in order to replicate the value of the option. And for the noise, we substitute the hedging rule for delta to obtain

<center>
$$\huge{(\alpha-r)S_t \partial_x c = -rc + \partial_t c + \alpha S_t \partial_x c + \frac{1}{2}\sigma^2 S_t^2 \partial_{xx} c}$$
</center>

We can divide both sides to arrive at the Black-Scholes partial differential equation. 

<center>
$$\huge{r c(t,x) = \partial_t c(t,x) + rx \partial_x c(t,x) + \frac{1}{2}\sigma^2 x^2 \partial_{xx} c(t,x)}$$
</center>

for $\huge{t\in[0,T)}$ and $\huge{x\geq 0}$, with the terminal condition $\huge{c(T,x)=(x-K)^+}$. To emphasize that the PDE is not random, in the arguments, but it is a deterministic function, we change the second argument to $\huge{x}$. We can evaluate $\huge{c}$ at any time and any stock price $\huge{x=S_t}$.

# Solving the PDE

Let's examine again the discounted price process of the option, we notice that in the parenthesis we can recover the Black-Scholes equation by substituting $\huge{x=S_t}$, which means the $\huge{dt}$ term must be equal to zero.

<center>
 $$\huge{d(e^{-rt}c(t,S_t))= \\e^{-rt}[-r c+\partial_t c + \alpha S(t) \partial_x c + \frac{1}{2}\sigma^2 S_t^2\partial_{xx}c]dt+e^{-rt}\sigma S_t\partial_x c dW_t} = e^{-rt}\sigma S_t\partial_x c dW_t $$
</center>

We have a stochastic differential equation without drift, which means the stochastic process $\huge{w(t,S_t)=e^{-rt}c(t,S_t)}$ is a martingale (w.r.t. the Brownian motion $\huge{W_t}$). (a detailed discussion can be found on [stackexchange](https://quant.stackexchange.com/questions/15795/why-is-this-stochastic-integral-a-martingale)). We can use the property of martingales that their expectation does not change, in particular it admits $\huge{\mathbb{E}[w_0]=\mathbb{E}[w_T]}$. But at expiration we now exactly the value of the option, that is 

<center>
$$\huge{W(T,S_T) = e^{-rT}(S_T-K)^+}$$
</center>

At time $\huge{0}$, the stock price is known so the process $\huge{w(0,S_0)}$ is known so it's expectation is constant, this implies that the stock price can be calculated as 

<center>
$$\huge{w(0,S_0) = \mathbb{E}[w(0,S_0)]=\mathbb{E}[w(T,S_T)=\mathbb{E}[e^{-rT}(S_T-K)^+]}$$
</center>

We derived that the option price must be equal to the expected present value of the payoff. So the only thing left to do is calculate this expected value. One approach is to run simulations of the stock price, calculate the discounted payoffs and set the price as the empirical average of our results. But we choose the sophisticated way, calculate the integral explicitly.
