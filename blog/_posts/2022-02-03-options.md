UNDER CONSTRUCTION!

A European call option gives the owner the right to acquire the underlying security at expiry at a predefined price called the strike $\huge{K}$. For an investor to profit from a call option, the stock's price, at expiry, has to be trading above the strike price. In this case an agent exercises the option, buys the stock for $\huge{k}$ and immediately can sell it for the current stock price $\huge{S_t}$. Otherwise he do not gain any profit. This can be summarized with the payoff function below.

<center>
$\huge{payoff = max(S_T-K,0) = (S_T-K)^+ =(S_T-K)1_{S_T>K}}$
</center>

```python
def payoff(x, K):
    payoff_lambda = lambda x: max(x-K, 0)
    return np.array(list(map(payoff_lambda, x)))
```

The stock price is assumed to be driven by the following stochastic differential equation
<center>
$$\huge{dS_t = S_t \huge{\alpha} dt + S_t \sigma d W_t ~~~~~ S_0=s_0}$$
</center>
where $\huge{S_t}$ is the price of the stock at time $\huge{t}$, $\huge{\alpha}$ is the mean rate of return, $\huge{\sigma}$ is the volatility and $\huge{W_t}$ is a Brownian motion. We can think of this equation as a stock price evolution. In a small time interval the price change is determined by two factors, the first term is sometimes called the "drift" it drives the price upwards if its positive, it is completely deterministic in our case, the second term is the volatility term, sometimes called the "noise". It is random and scaled by the constant volatility term. The randomness comes from the Brownian Motion, which can be viewed as a continuos-time random walk, it is also responsible for the spikes we can observe when looking at a stock price.

The main question regarding a financial derivative is that what is its fair price? How much are we willing to pay to enter a contract of having the possibility to buy a stock at a given price at a given time. The price of the option matures as time $\huge{T}$ is the expected value of the discounted cashflow the security generates, that is $$\huge{V(t) = \mathbb{E}[e^{-r(T)}(S_T-K)^+]}$$, where $\huge{r}$ is the risk-free rate of return.
There are multiple ways of computing or approximating this expected value. One way is by the celebrated Black-Scholes formula, which we do not derive here, we just use it as a benchmark for our simulations. Black-Sholes formula argues that the price of the option depends on the current price of the stock, the strike price, the risk-free return and the volatility of the market.

```python
def black_scholes(s0, K, T, r, sigma):
    d_1 = (np.log(s0 / K) + (r + 0.5 * sigma**2) * T) / (sigma * np.sqrt(T))
    d_2 = (np.log(s0 / K) + (r - 0.5 * sigma**2) * T) / (sigma * np.sqrt(T))
    price = s0 * norm.cdf(d_1, 0, 1) - K * np.exp(-r * T) * norm.cdf(d_2, 0, 1) 
    return price
```

In order to approximate the option price we will use the so called Monte Carlo Method:

<ol>
  <li>We simulate $\huge{M}$ copies of the stock price evolution $\huge{S}$</li>
  <li>We compute the hypothetical payoffs of these simulations</li>
  <li>As our estimation, we take the empirical average of these payoffs</li>
</ol>  

The problematic part is the stock price evolution itself. I will present three different solutions for the simulations. So our goal is to simulate somehow the above mentioned stochastic differential equation and arrive at a stock price at time $\huge{T}$. First we can use the method of Exact Simulation. The idea is that just like we can solve ordinary differential equations, it is possible to find a function $\huge{S(t,W_t)}$ which solves the SDEs. This function gives us the price of the stock, if we know the time $\huge{t}$ and the value of the Brownian motion az that time $\huge{W_t}$. This SDE is solved by the so called [Geometric Brownian Motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_Brownian_motion), which can be written as

<center>
$$\huge{S_0 \exp\left\{(\alpha-\frac{\sigma^2}{2})t + \sigma W_t \right\}}$$
</center>



```python
def exact_simulation(M, s0, K, T, r, sigma):
    s1 = s0 * np.exp((r - sigma ** 2 / 2) * T + sigma * np.random.normal(loc=0, scale=np.sqrt(T), size=M))
    estimates = np.exp(-r * T) * payoff(s1, K)
    return np.mean(estimates)
```

Euler Scheme



```python
def euler_scheme(M, N, s0, K, T, r, sigma):
    dt = 1/N
    s = s0 * np.ones(M)
    for step in range(N):
        normal = np.random.normal(loc=0, scale=1, size=M)
        s = s + s * r * dt + s * sigma * np.sqrt(dt) * normal
    estimates = np.exp(-r * T) * payoff(s, K)
    return np.mean(estimates)
```

Binomial Tree

```python
def binomial_tree(M, N, s0, K, T, r, sigma):
    dt = 1/N
    s = s0 * np.ones(M)
    for step in range(N):
        bernoulli = 2*np.random.randint(0,2,size=(M))-1
        s = s + s * r * dt + s * sigma * np.sqrt(dt) * bernoulli
    estimates = np.exp(-r * T) * payoff(s, K)
    return np.mean(estimates)
```
